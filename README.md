# Iterative Methods for Sparse Linear Systems
Implementation and testing of iterative methods for sparse systems of linear equations. 

Linear System:

Finite element discretization of 2D Poisson's equation with variable coefficient on regular grid (same as FD in this particular case).

Methods:

  1. Jacobi iterations
  2. Weighted Jacobi iterations
  3. Successive overrelaxation
  4. Gauss-Seidel method 
  5. Steepest Descent
  6. Conjugate gradient (CG) and it's preconditioned version
  7. Biconjugate gradient (BiCG) and it's preconditioned version
  8. Biconjugate Gradient Stabilized (BiCGStab) - in progress

Preconditioners:

  1. Jacobi
  2. Incomplete Cholesky
  3. Incomplete LU
